* Use a clear and descriptive title
* Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem
* Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps
* Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps
* Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why
* Include logs and error messages

### Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues. When creating an enhancement suggestion, please include:

* Use a clear and descriptive title
* Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement
* Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps
* Describe the current behavior and explain which behavior you expected to see instead
* Explain why this enhancement would be useful

### Pull Requests

* Fill in the required template
* Follow the Python style guide (PEP 8)
* Include appropriate test coverage
* Update documentation as needed
* End all files with a newline

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.10 or higher
* Git
* Linux system (for full testing)

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. Fork the repository

2. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/phreakwall.git
   cd phreakwall
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. Install development dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```

5. Create a branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Code Style

Phreakwall follows PEP 8 with some modifications:

* Line length: 100 characters (not 79)
* Use type hints for all function signatures
* Use docstrings for all public modules, functions, classes, and methods
* Follow Google-style docstring format

### Running Linters

```bash
# Format code
black phreakwall tests

# Check style
ruff check phreakwall tests

# Type checking
mypy phreakwall
```

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=phreakwall --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_compiler.py

# Run specific test
pytest tests/test_compiler.py::test_compiler_init
```

### Writing Tests

* Write tests for all new features
* Maintain or improve code coverage
* Use descriptive test names
* Use pytest fixtures for common setup
* Mock external dependencies

Example:
```python
import pytest
from phreakwall.core.compiler import Compiler

def test_compiler_initialization():
    """Test that compiler initializes correctly."""
    compiler = Compiler(options=default_options())
    assert compiler.VERSION == "6.0.0"
```

## Documentation

### Code Documentation

* All public modules, classes, and functions must have docstrings
* Use Google-style docstrings
* Include type hints
* Provide examples for complex functions

Example:
```python
def process_rule(rule: str, zone: str) -> List[str]:
    """
    Process a firewall rule for a specific zone.

    Args:
        rule: The rule specification string
        zone: The target zone name

    Returns:
        List of iptables commands

    Raises:
        ValueError: If rule is invalid

    Example:
        >>> process_rule("ACCEPT tcp 22", "net")
        ['iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT']
    """
```

### Documentation Files

* Update README.md for user-facing changes
* Update CHANGELOG.md for all changes
* Add examples to docs/examples/ for new features

## Commit Messages

### Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types

* **feat**: A new feature
* **fix**: A bug fix
* **docs**: Documentation only changes
* **style**: Changes that don't affect code meaning (formatting, etc.)
* **refactor**: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
* **perf**: Performance improvement
* **test**: Adding or updating tests
* **chore**: Changes to build process or auxiliary tools

### Examples

```
feat(compiler): add support for nftables backend

Implement initial nftables backend support alongside existing
iptables backend. Users can now choose between backends.

Closes #123
```

```
fix(zones): handle empty zone definitions correctly

Previously crashed when zones file was empty. Now handles
gracefully with a warning message.

Fixes #456
```
